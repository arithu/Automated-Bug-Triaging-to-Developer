\abstract{ \begin{spacing}{2}
In the field of computer science, binary decision diagrams (BDD) \cite{1} is a type of data structures that is used to represent Boolean functions. On a more abstract level, BDDs can be considered as a compressed representation of sets or relations. Unlike other compressed representations, operations are performed directly on the compressed representation, i.e., without decompression. BDDs are extensively used in CAD software to synthesize circuits (logic synthesis) and in formal verification. There are several lesser known applications of BDDs including Fault tree analysis, Bayesian Reasoning, product configuration, and private information retrieval. The proposed project is to study how BDDs can be constructed from Boolean functions, the various logical operation on BDDs that can be implemented by polynomial-time graph manipulation algorithms and the application of BDDs in encoding Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) \cite{2} and Sequence of Communicating Automata (SCA) \cite{7}.\end{spacing}
